# Azure RBAC Duplicate Service Principal Detection Bot

## Overview

The Azure RBAC Duplicate Service Principal Detection Bot is designed to identify duplicate service principals across Azure subscriptions and resource groups. It leverages Azure Python SDKs for management operations, Microsoft Graph API for principal details retrieval, and Azure services such as SQL Database and Blob Storage for data storage and logging.

## Features

- **Naming Convention**: azure_rbac_duplicate_service_principal_detection
- **Type**: Scan-Report
- **Services**: Security, Monitoring
- **Schedule run**: Daily
- **Retention Period**: 1 year
- **Primary Owner**: Jaswinder Singh
- **Secondary Owner**: Rajesh Nagapuri

### Key Functions

- Fetches role assignments for service principals at both subscription and resource group levels.
- Identifies duplicate service principals based on principal ID.
- Stores duplicate service principal details in Azure SQL Database.
- Logs all activities and errors to Azure Blob Storage with daily rotation.
- Provides email notifications for reporting and error alerts.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the bot, ensure you have the following:

- Python 3.x installed.
- Azure subscription(s) with appropriate permissions.
- Azure SQL Database for storing detection details.
- Azure Blob Storage for logging and storing logs.
- Azure Service Principal for authentication and access.
- Azure Python SDKs (`azure-mgmt-authorization`, `azure-mgmt-resource`, `azure-identity`).
- Microsoft Graph API access token for retrieving principal details.

## Setup

### Steps to Deploy

1. **Install Dependencies**: Install required Python packages using `pip`:
   ```
   pip install azure-identity azure-mgmt-authorization azure-mgmt-resource pandas requests
   ```

2. **Configure Azure Resources**:
   - **Azure SQL Database**: Create a database with necessary credentials.
   - **Azure Blob Storage**: Set up a storage account with a container for logs.
   - **Azure Service Principal**: Configure in Azure Active Directory with appropriate API permissions.

3. **Azure Pipeline Setup**: Utilize an Azure Pipeline for scheduled builds and deployments.

### Execution Flow

1. **Initialization**: Authenticate using Azure credentials and retrieve access token for Microsoft Graph API.
2. **Subscription and Resource Group Iteration**: Iterate through specified subscriptions and resource groups.
3. **Role Assignment Retrieval**: Fetch role assignments for service principals at both subscription and resource group scopes.
4. **Duplicate Detection**: Identify and record duplicate service principals.
5. **Data Handling**: Convert detected duplicates into a DataFrame and store in Azure SQL Database.
6. **Logging**: Log execution details and errors using a custom CSV logging handler.
7. **Error Handling**: Send email notifications for errors encountered during execution.

## Monitoring and Notifications

- **Monitoring**: Review Azure Pipeline logs, Azure Blob Storage for logs and exceptions, and Azure SQL Database for stored detection details.
- **Email Notifications**: Receive notifications for successful execution summaries and error alerts to designated stakeholders.
